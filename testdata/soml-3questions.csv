I have a collection of Languages which have both an ObjectId and the ISO code as a key. Is it better to use a reference to the Language collection or store a key like ""en"" or ""fr""?

I suppose it's a compromise between:

 - ease of referencing the Language
 - object in that collection
 - speed in doing queries where the sentence has a certain language
 - the size of the data on disk

Any best practices that I should know of?",mongodb,,,,,,open

At the moment my application produces:

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

But i need:

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
    <root xmlns=""namespaceURL"" 
    xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
    xs:schemaLocation=""namespaceURL pathToMySchema.xsd"">
    ...
    </root>

My code:

    StreamResult result = new StreamResult(writer);
    Document doc = getDocument();

    Transformer trans = transfac.newTransformer();
    trans.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, ""yes"");
    trans.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.METHOD, ""xml"");
    trans.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.VERSION, ""1.0"");
    trans.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.ENCODING, ""UTF-8"");

    DOMSource source = new DOMSource(depl.getAsElement(doc));
    trans.transform(source, result);
