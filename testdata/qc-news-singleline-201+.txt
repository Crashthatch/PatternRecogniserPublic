Hmm. Either Faye has the best poker face this side of ESPN2 or she really doesn't mind if Marten goes out with Dora. Interesting! Speaking of poker, I am completely addicted to the World Series of Poker. I'm not normally much on televised competition, but something about watchin' dudes and ladies gamble in a game where they actually have to use their minds is fascinating to me. Anyway I am going to cut this short. The doctor gave me some percoset (?!) for my ear pain today and it is making my brain all fuzzy. Enjoy the comic (which was not drawn while on painkillers, I promise) and I will see you tomorrow!

Good LORD was tonight's comic ever hard to write. Once I got past that, though, it was smooth sailing. I'm even somewhat happy with it! Exciting shirt news: The last of the first batch of M&S and Fighter Jet shirts went out in the mail today. I have a new labeling method which has greatly reduced the time it takes me to get shirts addressed and ready to be shipped. I hope to have all of the first batch of Aerodynamically Curvaceous shirts out in the mail tomorrow afternooon, and the first batch of Computers Are Our Friends shirts in the mail by the end of this week. People who ordered a shirt anytime between August 18th and now should have their shirts within six weeks- I will have another batch by the end of this month and will start sending those out as soon as I get them. I'm putting shirt sales on hold for a little bit while I work out some merch stuff in preparation for Christmas. I will let you know when everything goes back on sale so keep your eyes peeled. That's it for tonight. Enjoy the comic and I will see you tomorrow!

So Marten has a sexy new hairstyle and Faye appears to be letting contractions sneak back into her vocabulary. Truly this is a comic of changes! But then, if you're a regular reader you're probably used to that already. All of the first batch of Aerodynamically Curvaceous shirts are out in the mail now! I plan to start sending out Pintsize shirts tomorrow and Friday as quickly as possible. Keep an eye on your mailbox if you ordered a shirt! Not much else to report tonight. Enjoy ze comic, enjoy ze new haircut on Marten, and I will see you on Thursday!

Faye is like a cat that will let you pet it for a certain period of time, whereupon it decides that you need to reminded of your place in life and bites you on the hand. Marten gets bitten again and again, but he just doesn't give up. Dude is going to have some serious metaphorical scars at this rate. Shirts are going out at a steady rate, and the current batch should be all done by the middle of next week at the latest. This is starting to feel like an actual JOB a little bit! Being responsible and drawing a webcomic are two things that do not meet often enough in real life, but I am doing the best I can. Not much else to report tonight. Enjoy ze comic and I will see you tomorrow!

Tonight's comic should be especially amusing to those of you who particularly enjoy Italian desserts. Let's just say that it took all of my willpower not to make some very tasteless remarks about cannoli. Not a whole lot to report tonight. Shirt shipping continues, and I plan to re-open the store for a little while in a few days as I have a bunch of extra shirts that I would not mind selling. Keep your eyes peeled!

Cooking with Faye? This is probably not a good thing. So I have not actually played the Sims 2 yet, but judging from the character models and stuff it is pretty cool! Forum-goer Deltron made the QC cast and it is pretty darn accurate! Not much else to report tonight. I am supposed to say HELLO TO EMILY FROM NY right now so I just said it! Enjoy the comic and I will see you tomorrow.
