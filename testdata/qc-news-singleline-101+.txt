When writing the dialogue for today's strip, I had to check and see whether "flier" or "flyer" was the correct spelling- turns out both are acceptable. I went with flyer because that seems to be the one the airlines use the most. It's funny how sometimes the littlest details can be such a pain in the ass. Those of you who have poked around in the sketchbook thread in the forums have probably already seen Dora's new hairstyle. Before I get 10457 emails asking "what happened to her hair OMG??!??!", let's just assume she went and got a haircut, okay? Okay. Anyway I think I finally got her to look exactly as I imagined her in my head. She looks quite different from Faye now, and you can tell that she's meant to be skinnier and less, uh, full-chested than our sassy heroine. Hope you like the improvements. If not, I don't want to hear about it. :) Thanks so much to everyone who sent me emails and/or IMs congratulating me on strip #100, I really appreciate it. The next big milestone will be the 1-year anniversary, which will be August 1st. I'm looking forward to it. Not too much else to report tonight so I'll leave you to enjoy the comic. Have a nice weekend and I will see you on Monday!

Oh man did tonight's comic take a long time to draw. Started at about 8PM and I'm only just finishing now. Still, I'm pretty happy with how it came out. Each panel is all hand-drawn, there is no Photoshop copy n' paste trickery whatsoever. I seem to be doing this a lot more lately, perhaps because my compositions are getting a little more complex. We shall see. Tip T-shirts are in the mail, and should be to pretty much everywhere by the end of the week. Other shirts are still pending, but I should have more info very soon. If you or someone you know is looking for a good Windows machine, I happen to have one up for auction here. I think it's a pretty good deal for a kick-ass system. A lot of the earlier QC strips were drawn on this machine, before I switched to Apple hardware, so I can vouch for its power and reliability. All the system specs are in the item description, so if this sounds like something you would like to buy, feel free to drop a bid. it would be neat if this went to a QC reader, I would probably throw in a couple silly extra things as well. QC is hangin' tough over on Buzzcomix, it looks like we'll stay in the top 10 this month, which is super-cool. Some of my most vocal readers came to the strip via BCX, so I am glad that QC maintains a presence there. Thanks to everyone who votes! If you do not own the new Franz Ferdinand album, I STRONGLY suggest you immediately go out and buy it (or order it on Amazon). Seriously rockin' stuff- think Parklife-era Blur, or Interpol with more of a swagger and less rigor mortis (John from Scary Go Round will probably hate me for comparing them to Interpol, hehe). Anyway it is a very fun listen, and definitely something that Britpop or Interpol (or hell, even Rolling Stones) fans would enjoy. That's it for tonight. Time to go shut off my brain for a few hours. See you Wednesday!

I have heard numerous people (guys and girls) say that either they bought a pair of Diesel jeans or really want a pair because they have some kind of magical ass-flattering powers. I only make fun lightly, because where some people spend $200 on a pair of pants, I spend $1500 on an electric guitar. Hello pot, my name is kettle. I'm very happy with how Faye's profile and Dora's hand came out in the last panel of today's strip. I'm also pretty pleased with the background work in panel 1. Hopefully they are tolerable for your eyes to look at. Also hopefully you do not hate me for making more butt jokes. Butts are funny, I am sorry. I am currently battling my way through some pretty hardcore depression, the sort that makes a man want to stay under the covers all day, where he feels safer. I am trying to treat it as one treats a cold, with plenty of rest and fluids, in the hopes that it will lift soon. I absolutely refuse to let my mental state get in the way of making comics, though. For one thing it's a great way to keep my mind off of bad things, it is hard to have a panic attack when you are busy trying to figure out the proper position for a hand reaching to grab a butt. For another thing it is a kind of therapy, something that, no matter how bad things get, I can look back on and say "well, at least I drew a comic strip that I am pretty happy with." Anyway enough about my stupid personal life, you do not want to read about that. I have sent the Pintsize and Anti-Emo shirts to the printer, who tells me that they will be ready on or around April 5th. While this is a little later than I was expecting, I think it is okay to wait a little while longer. So many people ordered shirts that I actually got a discount on the printing costs, a feat that I never thought I would attain. Thanks so much to everyone who ordered a shirt! Also, just because they have gone to print does not mean you should hesitate from ordering one if you have not done so. In this vein, I will be discontinuing the Tip t-shirts as of April 1st, so if you want one you should order before then. I plan to replace them with something new that I think boys and girls alike will enjoy. That's all for now, I am going to go read comic books and drink boutique ginger ale. See you Friday!

Aw geez, guys. I really did not expect the metric fuckton of email and IMs wishing me well. I'm amazed that I have such caring fans, you guys went a long way towards cheering me up today. Thanks to your kind words I feel better tonight than I have in the past three days. I really can't thank you all enough, words don't properly express my gratitude. Hopefully this bonus comic is a good enough thank-you. It's absolutely wonderful to know that there are people out there who like my work. It's even nicer to know that those people care enough about my well-being that they email and/or IM me within hours of my post about being depressed to try and help me feel better. Anyway thanks so much, everyone. I'm going to be taking things one day at a time and just try to keep myself occupied as much as possible so I don't have time to obsess over negative thoughts. Your wishes (and in some case prayers!) help more than the best therapist ever could. Thanks again, enjoy the comic, and I will see you Friday with another one!

Did you check out the bonus comic I drew yesterday? If not, go read it! Everyone likes extra comics to read. Today's comic addresses the fine line that a parent and his or her offspring walk when discussing each other's sex lives. While I am definitely a big believer in honesty, the phrase "too much information" is perhaps nowhere better applied than in this realm. What I wonder is this: is it weirder to be a girl and get a sex toy from your mom, or to be a guy and get porn from your dad? I'm guessing they're equally creepy. Thanks again to everyone who sent me a nice email or IM hoping I would feel better. It's a little too soon to say for sure, but I have been doing better the past couple days due in no small part to your well-wishing. I really appreciate it. Do you like the idea of reading comic strips about a reincarnated pig? If so, then Banish Ed is for you! It is an enjoyable read and its author Eric is a Quality Fellow, therefore it gets my recommendation. I think sometime tonight I'm going to start another poll about new QC merchandise in the forums. Check in a few minutes and it should be up. I am very interested to know what people would like to see in terms of QC merch. It'd be great if I could keep all these t-shirt orders flowing in! Don't forget, you have until April 1 to order Tip shirts, then they are gone. Better get one soon if you're interested. That's all for tonight. Have a pleasant weekend, remember to vote for QC on Buzzcomix (and thanks for that!) and I will see you on Monday!

Sometimes a man takes a step back from his life for a brief assesment. Important events like the birth of a child or the death of a loved one might precipitate such introspection. Or it might just be that the man has drawn a 10-inch pink vibrator in a comic strip. If you like indie rock, you owe it to yourself to go buy American Analog Set's latest album, Know By Heart. It is wonderful, low-key pop music and a great extension of AAS' signature sound. I'm going to see them play here in Northampton in April, it should be a very fun show. Not a whole lot else to report tonight. Enjoy the comic and I will see you on Wednesday.
