I have a collection of Languages which have both an ObjectId and the ISO code as a key. Is it better to use a reference to the Language collection or store a key like ""en"" or ""fr""?

I suppose it's a compromise between:

 - ease of referencing the Language
 - object in that collection
 - speed in doing queries where the sentence has a certain language
 - the size of the data on disk
